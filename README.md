Hello! This was my final project for my Art 101 class at SJSU.
I created a dress-up game based on the movie Kamikaze Girls.
I put it up here to archive it. Here is a description:
In this project I created a dress-up game where you make a Lolita coordinate or outfit.
I focused on Simulation as you are simulating the experience of picking an outfit in Lolita fashion,
as the main character Momoko does each morning in the movie Kamikaze Girls. You look in a closet as
you would in real life to find your clothes. Like many other dress up games, its simulating finding
your ideal outfit and to dip your toes into the fashion. Part of it is simulating Momoko's experience
in the movie as she is an iconic Lolita who wants to look cute and embody the lavish Baroque life style.
It leans more into flat design on the interface as it is more simplistic but more skeuomorphic for the
dress up character and clothes. As for Theatrification, I played into the pink colors for the interface
to emphasize femininity, which lolita fashion can be a way to express it as well. I ultilized the Play,
Scenemanager, Sound, and Clickable libraries. I used the built in buttons for navigating pages and the
clickables for the wardrobe. The save button uses the appearance of the built in button and the
functionality of the clickable to insure that it only saves one image of the page each time.
If i had more time I would find a way to put the clothing pieces as icons for the buttons in
the closet. I tried to do that but the images would need to be cropped as they are optimized for
use on the body rather than as icons. In addition, if you use translate on the clickables, the original
location of them will be where you have to press them to use. The new location does nothing so if you
press on where the button looks like where it is, it doesn't work. so I had to assign the location of
the clickables one by one. I tried to add some of thhe same functionality of the built in buttons where
you mouse over it it will change colors, howevere that didn't work so I kept the clickables uniform.
I made the save button a built in button but it saved multiple images of the screen rather than only one.
So I ultilized the clickable translate glitch to make a new clickable where the save button is and then
translated it off screen so it is still functional while the appearance of the built in button is still there.
The game is functional and you can get the experinec of creating their own lolita outfit, mostly in the sweet
substyle. If I had more time to expand this, I would make other clothing items of the gothic lolita substyle.
